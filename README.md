### About

I don't just write code to pass exams; I build ecosystems.

My philosophy is simple: Theory is useless without execution. I built this portfolio because I was tired of standard, boring resume sites. I wanted a space that actually represents who I am—someone who cares about high-performance UI, complex backend logic, and the tiny details that make software feel alive.

Every repository here is a result of me trying to figure out how things work under the hood.

### The Portfolio

This isn't a static template. It's a custom-built React application designed to feel like a high-tech interface. It represents my interest in Cyberpunk aesthetics and modern frontend engineering.
