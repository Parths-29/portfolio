### 🛑 MISSION STATEMENT

I don't just write code; I build **ecosystems**. 
Most students build projects to pass a subject. I build them to solve problems, break them, and then rebuild them better. 

My philosophy is simple: **Theory is useless without execution.** Every repository you see on my profile is a testament to my obsession with understanding *how* things work under the hood—from the pixel-perfect rendering of a React component to the complex decision boundaries of a Neural Network.

### ⚔️ WHY THIS PORTFOLIO?

I was tired of the same boring, white-background portfolios that look like resume PDFs. 
I wanted a digital space that represents **who I actually am**:
* A developer who loves **Cyberpunk aesthetics**.
* A fan of **High-Tech UI** (inspired by Netflix & Sci-Fi interfaces).
* Someone who pays attention to the **micro-interactions** (animations, sounds, flow).

This isn't just a showcase; it's a playground where I experiment with the limits of Frontend Engineering.
